## Logomania - SVG Maker

The SVG logo creator is part of the curriculum of Carleton Coding Bootcamp. The assigment was designed so that can put into practice the skill we have learned so far, including unit testing with Jest. The application was challenging in the scence that it needed to be a class-driven application, in order to be able to run the test unit.

Based on the internet this is the definition of SVG - "An SVG file is an image saved in the Scalable Vector Graphic format. The vector graphic it contains can be scaled to any size without losing quality. For this reason, digital illustrators often save logos, charts, and other graphics intended to be shown at a variety of sizes as SVG files. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) developed the SVG format and released its initial version in 2001." - [Fileinfo.com](https://fileinfo.com/extension/svg)

These are the prompts to create the SVG logo, currently there is only code for <span class="color:blue;">Square, Triangle and Circle</span>

## Installation

Please follow the instructions to install the Logomania CLI application

1. Clone the Logomania repository
	```js
	git clone http://github.com/gusmiller/Logomania
	```
2. Install NPM Packaged. Application uses different dependencies: chalk, email-validator, and inquirer. 
	```js
	npm install
	```
3. Install Jest - Unit testing tool (Jest package is only for developing purposes)
	```js
	npm install --save-dev jest
	```
4. Run CLI application
	```js
	node index.js
	```
The package.json contains various metadata of the entire node application, it consists of key-value pairs in actual JSON format. This file is enough to describe the whole project. The most important nodes in this file are as follow: 

- **Repository**: This consists of the repository on which the package is stored.
- **Scripts**: We can define different scripts which could useful to run the package.
- **Config**: It consists of some configurations about the package.
- **Dependencies**: These are the set of dependencies that are necessary to use the package successfully.

For more information about the package.json please visit [geekforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-package-json-in-node-js/) website.

## Jest Unit-Testing

Jest is a framework for running "Unit Tests," a way for you to test the individual functions and components from your code to ensure future commits don't break something unexpected. 
Testing is very important when working with a team of programmers (or even by yourself) ---any commits pushed to your source control should be automatically built and tested to make sure you don't accidentally break anything. Developing is time-expensive and we do not want to lose our code.

Once you have installed the dependencies you can launch the test as follow:

1. Run Jest on the console.
	```js
	npm run jest
	```
2. Run by calling script. This must be configured in the **package.json** file
	```js
	npm run testpackage
	```
NOTE: Before running the package make sure you have created your tests unit tests. Example: shapes.test.js this will test the shapes.js file, of course the file MUST contain the code require for testing.
